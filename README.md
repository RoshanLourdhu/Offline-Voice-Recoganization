Offline Voice Keyboard with Grammar Correction
Project Overview

This project implements a system-wide, offline-capable voice keyboard designed to enhance accessibility and productivity.
It provides a floating textbox with microphone input, real-time speech-to-text transcription (using Vosk), and grammar correction (using LanguageTool).

The solution is lightweight, works without internet once models are installed, and integrates seamlessly with any active application by injecting text into the currently focused window.

Features

Do Not Upload Full Models Here

Vosk models are large (typically 100â€“500 MB) and should *not* be committed to this repository.  
Instead, users should download them manually and place them in this folder.


Recommended Model

We recommend the *English model* vosk-model-en-us-0.22 for best accuracy and compatibility.
